Luke! Luke! Luke!

She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
one another, slapping each other on the back.

HAN
(laughing)
Hey! Hey!

LUKE
(laughing)
I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
it!

HAN
Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
the credit and take all the reward.

Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

LEIA
(laughing)
Hey, I knew there was more to you 
than money.

Luke looks toward the ship.

LUKE
Oh, no!

The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
something!
(to mechanic)
You can repair him, can't you?

TECHNICIAN
We'll get to work on him right away.

THREEPIO
You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
gladly donate them.

LUKE
He'll be all right.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
beeps with happiness.
